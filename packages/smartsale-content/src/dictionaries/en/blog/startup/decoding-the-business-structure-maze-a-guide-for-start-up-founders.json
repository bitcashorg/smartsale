In a traditional corporation, the business is taxed on its profits and then the owners are taxed on their share of the profits when they receive distributions. With an S corporation, the business is not taxed at the corporate level, so the owners only pay tax once."

In addition, S corporations cannot have certain types of owners, such as other corporations or partnerships."
